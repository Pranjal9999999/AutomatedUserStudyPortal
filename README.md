Conducting, analysing and summarising one round of user studies takes ~9-10 hours. It is currently a manual and cumbersome process. With the power of generative AI, there is an opportunity to improve the efficiency of this process by reducing manual effort. Do you want to conduct user studies faster, easier, and better? Do you want to get valuable insights into user behavior, feedback, and satisfaction? Do you want to improve your product and service based on data-driven decisions? If yes, then you need our innovative tool: User Study Made Easy.

User Study Made Easy is a platform-independent browser extension that automates the process of conducting user studies based on user videos. It supports keystroke identification, summarization, user expression and behavior analysis, and AI model feedback. It also integrates with UHRS to provide quality assurance and data labeling.

With User Study Made Easy, you can:

Conduct user studies with minimal effort by letting the tool handle the video recording, template filling, and data processing.
Analyze user behavior, expressions, learning curves, and feedback using advanced AI models that provide actionable insights and recommendations.
Visualize user interactions with the webpage using cursor heatmaps and keystroke analysis that reveal user preferences and pain points.
Integrate with UHRS to access a large pool of users across different backgrounds and timezones and ensure data quality and reliability.
Store and manage your user study data on a secure cloud platform that allows easy access and sharing.
User Study Made Easy is the ultimate tool for internal developers who want to conduct user studies. It is easy to use, reliable, and scalable. It will help you improve your product and service based on user feedback and satisfaction. Donâ€™t miss this opportunity to enhance your development process. Try User Study Made Easy today!
Solution:

Step 1: The developer installs the User Study Made Easy browser extension on their preferred browser and configures the settings according to their needs. They can choose the template format, the video quality, the data storage location, and the UHRS integration options.
Step 2: The developer invites the users to participate in the user study and provides them with a link to access the webpage that they want to test. The users can use any browser that supports the extension.
Step 3: The users click on the link and start the user study. The extension records their video, audio, and cursor movements as they interact with the webpage. The extension also prompts them to provide feedback and answer questions at certain points during the study.
Step 4: The extension sends the user video to a cloud server where it is processed by two AI models: one for speech to text transcription and one for facial recognition transcription. These models generate two transcripts that capture the user's verbal and non-verbal cues during the study.
Step 5: The extension combines the two transcripts to create an intelligent transcript that summarizes the user's behavior, expressions, learning curves, and feedback. The extension also analyzes the user's keystrokes and cursor heatmaps to reveal their preferences and pain points.
Step 6: The developer provides some attributes that they want to emphasize in the user study, such as latency, learning curve, keystrokes saved, etc. The extension uses GPT-3 to summarize the intelligent transcript and the developer attributes and generate a comprehensive report that includes feedback, potential gaps, conclusion, user behavior analysis, and user satisfaction. The report highlights the attributes that the developer specified and provides actionable insights and recommendations.
Step 7: The developer can access and download the report from the cloud server or from the extension dashboard. They can also view and share the user video, transcripts, heatmaps, and other data from the dashboard. They can use this data to improve their product and service based on user feedback and satisfaction.
